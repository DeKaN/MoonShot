## MoonShot

##### *Incomplete; Under development*

MoonShot is an app that uses the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) to display information about upcoming launches.

MoonShot follows architectural best practices for Android, and aims to be a fully offline ready app. Unit tests are written for each layer as it is being built using a mix of Kotlin-Test and Junit-4.

MoonShot is currently under development, and will take a lot of time to be completed.
